    <h1>Physician Volunteers</h1>
    <p> Each week, the SNHC is staffed by one physician attending, who teaches and oversees the medical students.</p>

  <h2>Getting Involved</h2>
  <p>We are trying to recruit more <strong>Washington University-affiliated physicians who are boarded in emergency medicine, internal medicine, or OB/GYN</strong> to volunteer to attend at the clinic for approximately 4-5 hours on a Saturday morning, from 8:45AM to about 1:00PM or 2:00PM.</p>

  <p>We see 6-9 patients during each clinic session. You will work with up to three preclinical students and three clinical students. The students perform a full history and physical exam as time allows, then present and discuss the case with you. No orientation is needed for volunteer physicians, as our students are responsible for all paperwork. There is one student coordinator during each clinic session whose duty is to supervise paperwork and logistics. Periodically, the coordinator may  ask you to interpret lab results from the previous weeks' patients.</p>
                    
  <p> Since many of our patients do not have primary care physicians, we do our best to set up appointments and connect them with other community health facilities (such as the Family Care Health Center) for future care.
    We can only see individual patients up to 3 times per year, as we are currently unable to serve as a permanent primary care venue.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in volunteering, please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> at our general email. One of our physician coordinators (listed below) will be in touch with you to set a date that works best for you. Also feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. (A list of available dates can be found <a href="https://snhc.wusm.wustl.edu/Lists/SNHC%20Sign%20UP/physicianssignup.aspx">here</a>. Use your Medpriv). We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
