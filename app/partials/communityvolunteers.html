  <p>The Saturday Neighborhood Health Clinic welcomes members of the St. Louis community to help us improve the clinic and provide better services to our patients. Although we currently do not have many opportunities for hands on volunteering at the clinic, we are constantly looking to our community for their knowledge of health organizations, legal aid, business management and even marketing! In the future we hope to expand the efforts of the SNHC to reach a larger community and have a greater impact on those we serve. If you are interested in donating time, expertise, or funds to the SNHC please read below and provide us with a little more information about yourself.</p>
